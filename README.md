GestureTouchToolkit
===================
The GestureTouchToolkit is a (work in progress) toolkit for WPF that detects the size of
the touch input on a standard capacitive touchscreen by exploiting either the Stylus
API (GestureTouch.WPF) or by hooking into the native events send by the touchscreen
(GestureTouch.Native).
